This project is a “Online Application Real Estate Brokering” built using Java2EE technologies, including JSP, Servlets, JDBC,Java Beans and MySQL. The goal of this application is to provide an easy-to-use platform where buyers and sellers of properties can interact, with admins overseeing the process.
The application allows users to sign up, log in, and get directed to personalized dashboards
based on their roles (buyer, seller, or admin). The project also uses a MySQL database to
store user information, property listings, and transaction records.
The project uses JDBC for database interactions, HTML/CSS for frontend design, and
JSP/Servlets for backend logic, providing a complete web application for managing real
